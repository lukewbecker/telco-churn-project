# TELCO Churn Project - README

## Project Planning
 - Project Description:
The purpose for this project is to create a model that accurately predicts future Telco customer churn based upon the provided Telco customer dataset. Another primary goal is to identify what drivers to churn are present in the current customer base.

Part of the output from this project will be several files for you to use if you desire to recreate my work, which are: acquire.py, prepare.py, model.py and predictions.csv.
